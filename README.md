# Project Euler solutions

This repository will consist of my solutions for
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about). Each problem has its
own folder numbered according to its standing in the Project. I first solve it using simple solution, then improve it
using suggested solution from Project Euler.

I have solved each problem using Go. I have written benchmark file
too. 

To run these solutions. Go to each folder and run the following.

``` go build <problem.go>```

To run benchmark, run the following.

``` go test -bench=.```
